# ARC Development Planning & Roadmap

*Strategic development plan for the Agentic Renovation Crew IDE*

## 🎯 Project Vision

ARC (Agentic Renovation Crew) aims to be the first true IDE designed specifically for orchestrating multiple AI agents in a collaborative development environment. Our vision is to create a seamless interface where specialized AI agents work together to handle different aspects of software development, documentation, analysis, and project management.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Electron MVP First Approach
**Decision**: Build Electron version first, then fork to Tauri
**Rationale**: 
- Faster initial development with familiar web technologies
- Rich ecosystem of Node.js packages for AI integration
- Mature Electron tooling and debugging capabilities
- Easier integration with local AI models (Ollama, LM Studio)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity and performance  
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with Framer Motion for animations

## 🤖 Agent Architecture Deep Dive

### Agent Type Taxonomy

#### 1. Reactive Agents
```typescript
interface ReactiveAgent {
  type: 'simple-reflex' | 'model-based-reflex'
  sensors: SensorInput[]
  actuators: ActionOutput[]
  conditionActionRules: Rule[]
}
```
- **Simple Reflex**: Direct stimulus-response patterns
- **Model-Based Reflex**: World model for informed decisions

#### 2. Goal-Based Agents
```typescript
interface GoalBasedAgent {
  goals: Goal[]
  actions: Action[]
  searchStrategy: SearchStrategy
  evaluationFunction: (state: State) => number
