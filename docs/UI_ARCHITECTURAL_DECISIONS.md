# UI Architectural Decisions

## Decision: Adoption of Radix UI and Shadcn UI

### Date: 2025-09-27

### Status: Approved

### Context

As ARC (Agentic Renovation Crew) evolves, the need for a robust, accessible, and maintainable UI component library becomes paramount. The existing UI relies on custom CSS, which can lead to inconsistencies, accessibility challenges, and increased development time for new features.

### Decision

We will adopt **Radix UI** primitives and **Shadcn UI** components as the foundational UI stack for the ARC IDE. This decision is driven by the following key considerations:

1.  **WCAG 2.1, ADA, and A11y Compliance:** Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible component primitives that are rigorously tested for compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. Shadcn UI builds upon these primitives, ensuring that our UI components inherit a high level of accessibility out-of-the-box.

2.  **Personal Security and Cybersecurity Best Practices:** By leveraging well-audited and community-vetted component libraries, we reduce the surface area for potential security vulnerabilities that can arise from custom-built UI elements. The focus on headless components in Radix UI also means less reliance on client-side JavaScript for core functionality, further enhancing security.

3.  **Innovative Thinking and Developer Experience:** Shadcn UI offers a unique approach where components are copied directly into the project, allowing for full customization and ownership without the overhead of a traditional component library. This fosters innovative thinking by empowering developers to adapt and extend components precisely to ARC's needs, while maintaining a consistent and high-quality baseline.

4.  **TailwindCSS Integration:** Shadcn UI is designed to work seamlessly with TailwindCSS, providing a utility-first approach to styling that promotes rapid development and consistent design language across the application.

### Consequences

*   **Positive:**
    *   Significantly improved accessibility (A11y) for all users.
    *   Reduced risk of UI-related security vulnerabilities.
    *   Faster UI development and more consistent design.
    *   Empowered developers with customizable components.
    *   Modern and maintainable UI codebase.

*   **Negative:**
    *   Initial setup time for TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI.
    *   Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Radix UI, Shadcn UI, or TailwindCSS.

### Action Items

*   Follow the detailed setup plan outlined in `docs/UI_Blueprint.md`.
*   Ensure all new UI components are built using Shadcn UI where applicable.
*   Conduct regular accessibility audits of the application.
